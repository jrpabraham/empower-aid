Not that's particularly a bad thing.  But I don't imagine many will have something specific that $2 will buy in their country that's going to revolutionize their lives, though I don't know.  Perhaps healthcare needs if they have any which could be important/helpful.","The options of either ""They are poor because of laziness and lack of willpower or They are poor because society treats them unfairly. was harsh.  I don't come close to thinking either.  They were born into tougher circumstances, and haven't managed to get the innovation/bump in life that unlocks that situation.  All struggled at lower levels once (well, the majority, certainly not the monarchs and such, but pre-Industrial Revolution, most were in the same circumstances that folks living in poorer slums still are)... technology and innovation (partially luck, partially effort) unlocked life more for some, which has gradually expanded to benefit many... but it has not reached those born into and struggling in slums.  In places like America and Europe people born in poorer areas do have some opportunity to improve their lives.  But a person in a slum in Nairobi indeed doesn't have much opportunity to better their lives.  They might be able to work up to escape the slums to a better situation in Kenya or Africa.  But it's not like they'll be getting the bright situations even the poorest see in America/Europe (and parts of northern/eastern Asia, Australia, parts of South America, South Africa, etc).  So for these struggling in Kenya, I don't see either answer as representing my opinion whatsoever.  There are people who try to help those in the rougher situations.  Gradually a lot of the world has found things improving as a collective.  But I don't see it PRIMARILY being society taking advantage/mistreating the poor of the world (because the majority of the poor in the world are in such slums... such that even though I barely scrape life together in the US, I know I'm still in the top few percentage of the world).  There are those who make money off the backs of others, and they're relatively detestable in general... but they're not the cause of the poor's situation in general (as indeed, the poorness state was the default, and is slowly eroding), but just could be a bit better help to some... but I'm not sure if all the greed in the world were turned to lifting the poor around the world, people like the ones mentioned in African slums and rural poor areas would be suddenly in truly great lives.  So there's not a ton most poor (in most parts of the world) can do to turn things around, because numerically there will be poor with the current value of the world, apart from something more socialist (which may well not work to benefit well anyways)... but it's also not a large part because of people taking advantage of them/treating them unfairly.  It's the way it is mathematically, and things are gradually improving as more innovation happens... we do need to make sure benefits of new advances can spread to lift the many too and not just create opulence for few in coming centuries, as there will be a desire for the elite to yet further grow their ""kingdoms""... but as it is now I don't see things being horribly done.  And so neither option represents my thinking much at all.",1,,,,0,R_1FKyV4QOn0bUWFZ,FALSE,,FALSE,5
